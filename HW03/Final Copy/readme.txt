problem 1:
compile hw03p1.cpp and then run the binary
also read the explanation provided in the comments of the file

problem 2:
compile hw03p2.cpp and then run the binary

problem 3:
see how the functions are implemented bst_remove_all, insert and count in bag6.cpp
try running the hw03p3.cpp file but there seems to be problems with already implemented features 
of certain functions of remove causing it not to work.
